    "The Iris Dataset is one of the most famous datasets in the machine learning community. This dataset consists of the physical parameters of three species of flower — Versicolor, Setosa and Virginica. The numeric parameters which the dataset contains are Sepal width, Sepal length, Petal width and Petal length. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this excercise, we'll predict the species of the flowers based on these parameters. The data consists of continuous numeric values which describe the dimensions of the respective features. We will be training the model based on these features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What makes this excercise doable:\n",
    "* Attributes are numeric\n",
    "* This classification problem introduces fundamental supervised learning algorithms\n",
    "* It only has 4 attributes and 150 rows - small, easy to explore, and not memory intensive\n",
    "* All numeric attributes are of the same unit scale, not requiring any special scaling or transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "In this step-by-step tutorial you will:\n",
    "* Download and install Python SciPy and get the most useful package for machine learning in Python.\n",
    "* Load a dataset and understand it’s structure using statistical summaries and data visualization.\n",
    "* Create 6 machine learning models, pick the best and build confidence that the accuracy is reliable.\n"
