## Getting Started
1. Open the Azure link above in a new tab for a guided analysis of the Iris Dataset. This case study will introduce the following fundamental concepts of data science: 
* Installing the data science libraries
* Loading the dataset.
* Summarizing the dataset.
* Visualizing the dataset.
* Evaluating some algorithms.
* Making some predictions.
2. Clone the project to your own github (there's a button to clone within azure!)
3. Get started on the case study! There are guided solutions if you prefer a side by side approach.
